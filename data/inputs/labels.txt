1. The text discusses the formation of wind slabs.
2. Wind slabs are most likely to form in areas that have been loaded by recent moderate to strong winds from the SW-S-SE.
3. On the day before the text was written, the Titus Peak weather station reported several hours of 35 mph SE wind with gusts in the 40s.
4. The author observed freshly forming wind slabs in the Boulder Mountains on the day the text was written
The following text is about the dangers of avalanches:

Avalanches are most likely to occur when a stiff, wind-loaded slab of snow sits on top of a weaker layer of snow at the ground. This can happen on apparently sheltered slopes, as recent strong wind and settling within the heavy load of storm snow can create a cohesive slab in many locations.

Avalanches can break wider than you expect, spanning terrain features and changes in aspect. They may be triggered
The most likely areas to trigger a wind slab avalanche are in areas loaded by the recent moderate to strong SW-S-SE wind.

1. Areas where wind slabs are most likely to form are those where there has been recent moderate to strong winds from the SW-S-SE.
2. According to the Titus Peak weather station near Galena Summit, there were several hours of 35 mph SE winds with gusts in the 40s yesterday.
3. Wind slabs can be found at upper, middle, and some lower elevations, right down to the valley floor.
4. Be alert to obvious
Slab avalanches are most likely to occur when a stiff, wind-loaded slab of snow sits on top of a weaker layer of snow at the ground. Although wind-loaded areas are more hazardous, slopes that appear to be sheltered may also be dangerous due to the recent strong winds and settling within the heavy load of storm snow.
1. What is the most likely trigger for a wind slab avalanche?
2. Where will wind slabs be thicker and more widespread?
3. What are some signs of instability to be aware of?

1. The most likely trigger for a wind slab avalanche is in areas loaded by the recent moderate to strong SW-S-SE wind.
2. Wind slabs will be thicker and more widespread in upper elevations.
3. Some signs of instability to be
1. Strong winds and heavy snowfall have created dangerous conditions for avalanches.
2. Wind-loaded areas are particularly hazardous, but even apparently sheltered slopes can be dangerous.
3. Large avalanches have been seen in many parts of Idaho.
4. Persistent weak layers can cause avalanches to break wider than expected, so even gentle slopes can be dangerous.

The text is describing the dangers of wind drifts and how they can create slides.
1. Last week's snowfall and wind added a significant amount of new load to the snowpack, and our persistent weak layers are now buried 2-3+ feet deep in this area.
2. While less natural activity occurred in this zone compared to further north, several significant slides were observedincluding a large one on Titus Peak.
3. The persistent slab problem is intertwined with the wind slab problem discussed below.
4. You're most likely to trigger a persistent slab avalanche
1. stormy weather 2. wind 3. Wind slabs 4. skier or rider 5. wind drifted slopes 6. persistent slab 7. wind loaded slopes 8. buried weak layers
1. How much snowfall did the area likely receive last week?

This text is discussing possible dangers while skiing or snowboarding.
1. A persistent weak layer is buried beneath a dense slab.
2. Avalanches may be harder to trigger, but the resulting slides would be catastrophic.
3. Observations since the storm ended are still fairly limited.
4. Stick to lower slope angles and low consequence terrain to reduce your risk.

These areas are often referred to as wind scour, wind pillows, and wind slab.

6. Today is by far the warmest and sunniest day
1. Last week's extended storm cycle clobbered the Western Smokys, Sawtooths, and Banner Summit with 3 to more than 4 feet of new snow.
2. Numerous deep, destructive avalanches in the Sawtooths were revealed when the storm cleared on Wednesday.
3. Persistent weak layers in this zone are now buried around 3 feet deep at middle elevations and beneath a 4-5+ foot thick dense slab at upper elevations.

The text discusses the dangers of snowpack in the area increasing significantly. It states that while you may be less likely to trigger a deep slab avalanche, the consequences would be high if you were caught in one. It also explains that the snowpack won't give any signs of instability before it fails, and that avoiding the problem means avoiding the terrain where the problem exists.
1. It has been nearly five days since the snowpack was last stressed by a significant event. 2. The snowpack is unstable and signs of this continue to be present. 3. You can reduce your exposure to the hazard by avoiding steep slopes and areas where wind has created slabs. 4. Wind slabs are becoming less reactive over time, but if you do trigger one, it could lead to a larger avalanche.
1. The text discusses the hazardous conditions created by a weak snowpack.
2. The author suggests avoiding slopes where wind has created slabs, as these may be instability and trigger a larger avalanche.
1. The snowpack in this area increased significantly in the past two weeks and is now much deeper than in our southern areas.
2. Similar layers of weak snow exist here, but they are buried considerably further down in the snowpack.
3. This is a bit of a double-edged sword. While you may be a bit less likely to trigger one of these deeper slabs, the consequences of being caught in one would be catastrophically high.

The following text is a description of the risk of triggering a large, persistent avalanche on steep terrain. The likelihood of such an event occurring is low, but the consequences are severe. The text describes a situation where several riders in lower angled terrain caused an avalanche above them by collapsing the snowpack. The incident is a reminder to be aware of the potential for such an event occurring, even though the chances are small.
